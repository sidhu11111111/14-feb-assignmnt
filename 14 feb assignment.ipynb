    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program. A thread is a separate flow of execution that can run concurrently with other threads within the same process. Python provides the threading module to support multithreading in programs. Multithreading is used to improve the performance of applications by executing multiple tasks concurrently, which can help to make the application more responsive and efficient.\n",
